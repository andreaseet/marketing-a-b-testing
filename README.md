# marketing-a-b-testing

Project Overview: This is a A/B testing project to test a marketing landing page.

Project Summary: A product manager for a e-commerce mobile platform has prioritized landing page feature iterations for this quarter. In the meeting, they mention that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year and we want to see a 3% increase in the conversion rate. Our goal is to test out Variation B of the product page to determine if we should roll-out this design.
